Sidonia is a forum software that provides a forum template for hobbyists, casual talk-starters or even small businesses. The purpose of Sidonia is talking/discussing about a topic in an organized place where it's not very clustered and disorganized like we see in groups in Facebook. People will be able to easily find a topic they want to talk about under any kind of forum they're listed under and talk about the relative stuffs there instead of losing that content/comment thread like you would in Facebook. The UI design is meant to look very easy on the eyes yet eye-catching. It's sleek and it's inspired by various website designs awarded for the UI.
